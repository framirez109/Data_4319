<h1>Essentials of Unsupervised Learning</h1>

In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher. UL  is often used for clustering, anomaly dectection and novelty detection, visualization and dimentionality reduction, 

Clustering

Say you have a lot of data about your blogâ€™s visitors. You may want

Visualization 

You feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data and they output a 2d or a 3d representation of your data that can easly be plotted, These algorithms try to preserve as much structure as they can so that you can understand how the data is organized and perhaps identitfy unsuspected patterns. 

Dimentionally reduction

The goal is to simplify the data without loosing too much information. One way to do this is to merge several correlation features into one.  

Annomonly Detection

The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, so it learns to recognize them; then when it sees a new instance, it can tell wether it looks
