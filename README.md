This repository is in relation to DATA_4319. The course covers Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinsforcement learning algorithms.

* Supervised Learning 

In Supervised learning problems we have both an x and y variable where x represents the data we're providing as input into our model and y represents an outcome we're trying to predict also known as the label. These types of algorithms can be classified into two categories: Regression and Classification models.
   - Regression models usually has y as a continous variable such as the number of sales of a product or predicting the future price of an asset.
   - Classification models typically have a catergorical y value  that consist of a label that assigns each instance of x to a particular caterogry.  
Unsuperisved Learning utlizes ____. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning ______. These type of algorthims can be found in _____. L
