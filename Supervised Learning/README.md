<h2>Essentials of Supervised Learning</h2>

Supervised learning we have both x and y varible where x represents the data we utilze to make predictions known as labels. 
The goal of Supervised learning is to use our model to learn some function that uses x to approximate y.
There are typically two types of supervised learning: Regression and Classification models.

Regression Models deal with continious variable. A typical task is to predict a target numberic value given a set of features called predictors. In machine learning, an attribute is a data type(e.g "mileage") while a feature generally means an attribute  plus its value.

Classification models deal with catergorical variables. In this model our y-values consit of labels that assign
each instance of x to a particular category.
