Supervised Learning

Supervised learning we have both x and y varible where x represents the data we utilze to make predictions known as labels. 
The goal of Supervised learning is to use our model to learn some function that uses x to approximate y.
There are typically two types of supervised learning: Regression and Classification models.

Regression Models deal with continious variable. Examples include predicting the number of sales of a product
or predicting the future asset like a home

Classification models deal with catergorical variables. In this model our y-values consit of labels that assign
each instance of x to a particular category.
