This repository is to be used as a guide to DATA_4319. The course covers Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning algorithms.


<h2>Supervised Learning</h2>

In Supervised learning problems we have both an x and y variable where x represents the data we're providing as input into our model and y represents an outcome we're trying to predict also known as the label. These types of algorithms can be classified into two categories: Regression and Classification models.
   - Regression models have y as a continuous variable. Examples would be such as the number of sales of a product or predicting the future price of an asset.
   - Classification models have a categorical y value that consist of a label that assigns each instance of x to a particular category.
  
<h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not have a label y. These types of algorithms have some type of data x that we can put into a model, but we have no outcome y to predict. The goal of these algorithms is to have our model discover some hidden, underlying structure within the data. Such examples of this would be generative adversarial networks or k-means clustering.


<h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>

Reinforcement algorithms are problems we can frame as having an agent taking a sequence of actions within some environment. The agentâ€™s actions influence the information that the environment provides to the agent- that is, the agent receives direct feedback on the actions it takes. Examples of this would be an algorithm driving a car or playing a video game.
